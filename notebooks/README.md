# Notebooks

- Use this folder for quick experiments not tied to a milestone.
- For graded or milestone-specific work, place notebooks in `../milestones/Mx/`.

Tips:
- Keep outputs small; save figures to `reports/figures/` when possible.
- Use `from project import ...` to import utilities from `src/project/`.
